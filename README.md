# Prediction-of-Wine-Type-and-Quality

This project examines the application of Deep Learning techniques in classifying and predicting the quality of wines based on their physicochemical properties. The dataset contains features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, sulphur dioxide levels, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol content, and quality. We add an additional column labeled 'type', which indicates 0 and 1 for white and red wine, respectively.
We use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, specifically a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model, to accurately classify wines as red or white. In addition, regression models—including both traditional Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning architectures—were employed to predict wine quality scores. While the classification model achieved high accuracy, the regression models, such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor, faced challenges in capturing the complex patterns of quality assessment, with moderate R² scores. 
The study highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in classification tasks and the limitations encountered in predicting subjective quality using physicochemical data alone. This dual-approach project offers insights into modeling strategies for both categorical and continuous wine-related outcomes.

The dataset used in this project is based on the publicly available Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Some versions of this dataset are also available on Kaggle.
